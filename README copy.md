I can't create actual images or designs in Figma directly, but I can guide you step-by-step to create the design yourself in Figma. Here’s a more detailed guide on how to visually structure the **CitizenConnect360** platform, focusing on key elements and layout for the pages we've discussed.

---

### **1. Homepage Design**

#### **Header:**
- **Position**: At the top of the page, use a fixed position for easy navigation.
  - **Logo**: Place the logo on the left side (use a simple and clean design, possibly a combination of "CitizenConnect360" or an icon representing connectivity or civic engagement).
  - **Navigation Links**: Horizontal navigation bar with links: Home, About Us, Features, Login/Signup.
  - **Get Started Button**: On the right side, use a bold and contrasting button with a call-to-action text like "Get Started".

#### **Hero Section (Above the Fold)**:
